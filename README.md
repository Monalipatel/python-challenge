What did I do?

I used Pythonic language in a Jupyter Notebook for two separate mini-projects: (1) to analyze polling data and find a winning candidate for a fictional local election and (2) to analyze a fictional business's Profit/Loss Statement

PyBank


![](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll


![](Images/Vote_counting.png)

Create a Python script to analyze and modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv] The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.
